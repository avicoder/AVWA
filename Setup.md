Another Vulnerable Web Application

1.	Install Easy PHP
2.	Go to 127.0.0.1/home and click on phpmyadmin
3.	Create new database with the name same as sql file name for example if the name is autoparts.sql then the database name should be autoparts.
4.	Click on newly created db.
5.	Click on sql tab
6.	Open SQL file from the database folder inside the zip archive.
7.	Copy the content and paste it in the sql query text box and click go
8.	Do the same for all sql file inside the database folder given .
9.	Now copy Labs folder inside the local web directory ,  you can click on easyphp icon in notification bar and select explore.
10.	Extract every thing from the setup.zip in localweb only. Do not attempt to create a folder and then extract it. It could break the hard coded url inside the application

If you have any difficulty then look for POC.txt  file inside each test case folder .
Thanks .
