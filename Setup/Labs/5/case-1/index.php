  <div class="panel-body"><p>
Allowing invalidated inputs to control files that are included dynamically in PHP/JSP/ASP/Perl code can lead to malicious file inclusion attack. When the file that is included is derived from another host or website, it is termed as Remote File Inclusion.</p>
<p>
To enable code-reuse and modular programming, modern languages allow common functions to be written into a common library file. This library file is then included into main application program files, using file include functions. These included library files are interpreted by the compiler as part of the main application program in which they were included. 
File inclusion vulnerabilities occur when the path of the included library file can be controlled via unvalidated user input.</p>

 <tr><td>2</td><td>File Upload with extension check-
(Applicable mainly to PHP and perl websites only) .Upload a file that contains php code with extension .jpg. By default, the PHP interpreter doesnâ€™t restrict the extension of a file with PHP code, it executes code contained in any file, regardless of the extension. Now to execute this file using the vulnerable PHP code, the exploit will be <br />

 <tr><td>2</td><td>File upload with extension, content-type and file header checks
(applicable only to php and perl)
<br/>
Create an image that will contain PHP code within its bytes. Anything inside the &lt;? and ?&gt; tags is interpreted by PHP as PHP code. Using a hexadecimal editor insert PHP code at the end of an image file and then upload the file to the server.
<br />

<tr><td>2</td><td>Variables in HTTP request are prefixed by a fragment of a filename
include(/hr/payslip-$uid.php) <br/>

Since a fragment of a filename is prefixed, part of the file is already specified. In such cases we have to rely on how the underlying operating system treats non-existent directories.
